  "description": "In this assignment, you will make LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data. ### Before You Begin 1. LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies. 2. Make a new GitHub repository called liri-node-app and clone it to your computer. 3. To retrieve the data that will power this app, you'll need to send requests using the `axios` package to the Bands in Town, Spotify and OMDB APIs. You'll find these Node packages crucial for your assignment.    * [Node-Spotify-API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-spotify-api)    * [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)      * You'll use Axios to grab data from the [OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com) and the [Bands In Town API](http://www.artists.bandsintown.com/bandsintown-api)    * [Moment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment)    * [DotEnv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)",
